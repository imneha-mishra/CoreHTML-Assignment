    <h2>Full Stack Webevelopment :- In general, a tech stack can be a front-end tech stack,
         back-end tech stack, or a mix of both — i.e., a full stack.</h>
         <h3>

        <dt>Frontend tech stack :-
        </dt>
        <dd>For most of the web applications, the choice of frontend tech
             stack remains similar. Modern web applications are based on HTML,
              CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, or
             frameworks based on JS, like React, Vue, and Express</dd><br>
             <dt>Backend tech stack :-</dt>
             <dd>The backend tech stack (or server-side tech stack) consists of many components,
                 like the database, server, framework, and operating system. You have to
                  choose the server-side frameworks and tools carefully, because some technologies are lightweight, fast, and suitable for basic purposes, whereas some
                 are loaded with features that only a complex application might need</dd><br>
                 <dt>Frameworks :-</dt>
                 <dd>Frameworks provide a structure to the application and have common utilities so that you don't have to write every piece of logic from scratch. Some popular web 
                    frameworks are Express, Spring, Django, Laravel, Rails, and .NET.</dd><br>
                    <dt>Databases:-</dt>
                    <dd>Databases are an integral part of a tech stack. Whether your application is simple or has many workflows, you need a place to store all your information. Some popular databases are MongoDB and MySQL. Modern data platforms like MongoDB further enhance the functionality of a database by providing intelligent querying, aggregation, and transformation features, in addition to data storage and retrieval.

                        There are many other components — like APIs, analytics tools, BI tools, cloud services, and microservices — that can enhance the functions of an application.</dd>
